## What I Implemented
- Developed all DAO (Data Access Object) interfaces and their implementations to handle database interactions.
- Created all model classes representing core application entities.
- Defined all enum classes for standardized constant values.
- Wrote some of the unit tests to ensure correctness and reliability.
